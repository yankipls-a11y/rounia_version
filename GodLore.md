Vale Goddess of Love and Marriage
her true title is "goddess of love and lust" though most people over the years choose to forget the latter part of her title. She's the Goddess that people have dedicated to the Day of Love or Valentines Day due to her power over the heart and making people fall in love with each other. Usually prayed to by people who want to have blessings over their relationship and its longevity. She is also called upon during Marriages to unite the two prospective spouses in holy matrimony hence people over the years replacing her second title of "lust" to "marriage"
Var Hesto and Zivla Rhoh the God and Goddess of the Sands
These two gods during their early years used to fight on which one of them is truly worthy of taking on the title of the God/dess over a wonderful and sprawling domain. But due to their constant fights ended up destroying that domain and basically turning almost the entire place into dust which became the desert region now known as Ankhart. When both of them noticed what they had done to the land where their people worshipped them they became wracked with guilt and worked together instead to help their people prosper and eventually found love in each other. These days they are still worshipped by the people of Ankhart as both their deities to the Sand.
