Vale Goddess of Love and Marriage
her true title is "goddess of love and lust" though most people over the years choose to forget the latter part of her title. She's the Goddess that people have dedicated to the Day of Love or Valentines Day due to her power over the heart and making people fall in love with each other. Usually prayed to by people who want to have blessings over their relationship and its longevity. She is also called upon during Marriages to unite the two prospective spouses in holy matrimony hence people over the years replacing her second title of "lust" to "marriage"

Var Hesto and Zivla Rhoh the God and Goddess of the Sands
These two gods during their early years used to fight on which one of them is truly worthy of taking on the title of the God/dess over a wonderful and sprawling domain. But due to their constant fights ended up destroying that domain and basically turning almost the entire place into dust which became the desert region now known as Ankhart. When both of them noticed what they had done to the land where their people worshipped them they became wracked with guilt and worked together instead to help their people prosper and eventually found love in each other. These days they are still worshipped by the people of Ankhart as both their deities to the Sand.

Draconica Goddess of Dragons
Formerly just a regular Dragon that got granted godlike powers in her later life, She's known as the Matriarch of all dragonkind and most if not all dragons, draconic, or dragon-related beings in the world can trace their origins back to her. She was one of the first dragons to ever wield the magic to transform into a humanoid form which some interested dragons have since tried to learn. Some dragons have even been reported to worship and look up to her as, according to them, she has one of the best hordes of all: their entire kind.

Vordam Basan God of Souls
Once just a soul the Goddess of death took pity on, Vordam has since become a God himself and a loyal assistant for the Goddess of death helping the souls she takes to the afterlife and helps them get sorted into where their afterlife they should stay. Usually very calm and nice, but if a soul should try to run into a place they shouldnt go he exterminates their soul in the blink of an eye effectively removing them from existence.

Suko Goddess of Space
One of the oldest Gods in existence only second to the Existence Gods, Suko is the very manifestation of space and spends her time creating entire solar systems eternally adding new stars and planets in the night sky. Not much is known about her as records of her a very scarce, but she was the one who bestowed power to and ascended the ancient hero Mystica Alexandria into a cosmic being of the stars and tasked her with watching over our world.

Zel'nia Goddess of the Drows
It's been written in the religious books by the drow that Zel'nia was responsible for protecting the drows when their original ancestors were driven from the surface world down into the underdark by the other elves. There's a religious split as to how one should approach her teachings, one side believes that the drow should stay in the underdark and forever hate the surface and its dwellers for driving their race down there in the first place. While most believe that she was simply there back then to simply protect her people but that they should not hold any resentment for any of the surface dwelling people and actually try to get along with them. Whichever the case though, both sides of the religious coin have had drows blessed with Zel'nias powers making things complicated as how to truly worship her.
